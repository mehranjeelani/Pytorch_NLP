Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It's one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.\n","\n","Text classification algorithms are at the heart of a variety of software systems that process text data at scale. Email software uses text classification to determine whether incoming mail is sent to the inbox or filtered into the spam folder. Discussion forums use text classification to determine whether comments should be flagged as inappropriate.\n","\n","**_Example:_** A simple example of text classification would be Spam Classification. Consider the bunch of emails that you would receive in the your personal inbox if the email service provider did not have a spam filter algorithm. Because of the spam filter, spam emails get redirected to the Spam folder, while you receive only non-spam (\"_ham_\") emails in your inbox.\n","\n","![](http://blog.yhat.com/static/img/spam-filter.png)\n","\n","## Task\n","Here, we want you to focus on a specific type of text classification task, \"Document Classification into Topics\". It can be addressed as classifying text data or even large documents into separate discrete topics/genres of interest.\n","\n","\n","![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*YWEqFeKKKzDiNWy5UfrTsg.png)\n","\n","In this project, you will be working on classifying given text data into discrete topics or genres. You are given a bunch of text data, each of which has a label attached. We ask you to learn why you think the contents of the documents have been given these labels based on their words. You need to create a neural classifier that is trained on this given information. Once you have a trained classifier, it should be able to predict the label for any new document or text data sample that is fed to it. The labels need not have any meaning to us, nor to you necessarily.\n","\n","## Data\n","There are various datasets that we can use for this purpose. This tutorial shows how to use the text classification datasets in the PyTorch library ``torchtext``. There are different datasets in this library like `AG_NEWS`, `SogouNews`, `DBpedia`, and others. This project will deal with training a supervised learning algorithm for classification using one of these datasets. In task 1 of this project, we will work with the `AG_NEWS` dataset.\n","\n","## Load Data\n","\n","A bag of **ngrams** feature is applied to capture some partial information about the local word order. In practice, bi-grams or tri-grams are applied to provide more benefits as word groups than only one word.\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","*\"I love Neural Networks\"*\n","* **Bi-grams:** \"I love\", \"love Neural\", \"Neural Networks\"\n","* **Tri-grams:** \"I love Neural\", \"love Neural Networks\"\n","\n","In the code below, we have loaded the `AG_NEWS` dataset from the ``torchtext.datasets.TextClassification`` package with bi-grams feature. The dataset supports the ngrams method. By setting ngrams to 2, the example text in the dataset will be a list of single words plus bi-grams string."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"SbPLe8RV8GkG","colab_type":"code","outputId":"b0935a90-c4af-4613-854c-dc7f062eae89","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1579865193237,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":35044,"user":{"displayName":"kai

Moreover, with more number of tasks, the number of variables that you will be using will surely incerase. Therefore, it is recommended that you use separate notebooks for each _Task_ in this project.\n","\n","## NOTE 4:\n","You are expected to write well-documented code, that is, with proper comments wherever you think is needed. Make sure you write a comprehensive report for the entire project consisting of data analysis, your model architecture, methods used, discussing and comparing the models against the accuracy and loss metrics, and a final conslusion. If you want to prepare separate reports for each _Task_, you could do this in the Jupyter Notebook itself using $Mardown$ and $\\LaTeX$ code if needed. If you want to submit a single report for the entire project, you could submit a PDF file in that case (Word or $\\LaTeX$).\n","\n","All the very best for project 2.
